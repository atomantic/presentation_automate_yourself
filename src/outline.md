Title: Automate Yourself Out of a Job

Description:
Don't be afraid of automation; take control of it! One of the most rewarding parts of knowing how to code is using it to remove the tediousness of tasks that get in the way of humans being creative. Areas ripe for automation are all around you. We'll go over some examples of how code has evolved to automate away some of the tediousness of the past, some examples of why the future of automation means more jobs, not fewer, and how to think about automation as a tool to speed up your own work, allowing you to provide more value while evolving skills to own future automated systems.
